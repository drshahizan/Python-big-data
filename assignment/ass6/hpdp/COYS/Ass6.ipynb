This can be achieved by selecting specific columns or rows that are relevant to the analysis, or by loading the data in chunks. |\n","| Use Chunking | Process the data in smaller pieces to avoid memory issues. This can be done by dividing the data into smaller chunks and processing each chunk separately. |\n","| Optimize Data Types | Fine-tuning data types can maximize efficiency and minimize memory consumption. For example above we can se the reduction of memory usage is about 78.08%|\n","| Sampling | Implement sampling methodologies to extract meaningful insights from a subset of the dataset. This can be useful when the dataset is too large to process in its entirety. Sampling can be done randomly or systematically. |\n","| Parallelize with Dask | Dask is a powerful library that extends pandas to enable parallel and distributed computing. It's particularly useful for handling larger-than-memory datasets.
