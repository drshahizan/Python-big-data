# Project Title - EDA on The Nasa Jpl Aesteroid :boom:

In this project, we are going to do an exploratory data analysis of Nasa Jpl Aesteroid. We have found from [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset) The dataset contains various information about the asteroids and labels each asteroid as hazardous or non-hazardous.

# Inference and Conclusion

The project was quite enlightening. We gained a lot of knowledge about the many Python packages that may be applied to data science. From the analysis, we can see that most of the asteroids are not hazardous and most are classified as MBA.
