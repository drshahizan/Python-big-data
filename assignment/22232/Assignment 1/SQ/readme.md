Online payment is the most prevalent transaction technique in the world today. However, with an increase in online purchases comes an increase in payment fraud. The goal of this study is to identify fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains historical information about fraudulent transactions that can be used to detect fraud in online payments. This dataset was found on Kaggle and has the size of **493.53 MB**.
