## ðŸš€ Case Study 2 : Alternatives to Pandas for Processing Large Datasets

Pandas library has became the de facto library for data manipulation in python and is widely used by data scientist and analyst. However, there are times when the dataset is too large and Pandas may run into memory errors. Here are 8 alternatives to Pandas for dealing with large datasets. For each alternative library, we will examine how to load data from CSV and perform a simple groupby operation. Fortunately many of these libraries have similar syntax as Pandas hence making the learning curve less steep.
1. Data Table
2. Polars
3. Vaex
4. Pyspark
5. Koalas
6. cuDF
7. Dask
8. Modin

This case study is divided into two parts:
1. Case Study: 2a
  * Please use the appropriate dataset.
  * You need to carry out an explanation related to the basic concept of the library.
  * Please show the code step by step of its implementation.
2. Case Study: 2b
  * You are required to compare Pandas with the selected library
  * Make sure you use the same dataset when making comparisons.
  * You can also use visualization to show the comparison.
