The victim of a fraudulent transaction may lose money, personal property, or personal information. This theft can have severe consequences that extend beyond monetary losses. This study will examine the fraudulent transaction data of a financial institution and provide insight into the findings.

## Dataset

Using the dataset, we develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions at a financial institution and then create an actionable plan based on the model's insights. The case data is available in *CSV* format, with 11 columns and 6362620 rows. The file size is *493.53 MB*. The purpose of this study is to comprehend how financial fraud operates and how it can be prevented in the future.

The dataset is found from kaggle datasets: [Fraudulent Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitwanmanchanda/fraudulent-transactions-data)
