**<h2>What is Python-Koalas? üê®</h2>**


python-koalas is a package that provides a data manipulation library for Python. It is designed to be used on top of Apache Spark, a powerful open-source data processing engine for distributed computing. python-koalas offers a familiar API to users of pandas, a popular data manipulation library for Python, and aims to be compatible with a large portion of the pandas API.

One of the main benefits of python-koalas is its ability to scale to very large datasets. While pandas is often used for working with relatively small datasets that can fit in memory on a single machine, python-koalas is designed to handle datasets that are too large to fit in memory on a single machine, by using Spark to distribute the data and computation across a cluster of machines. This makes python-koalas an attractive choice for data scientists and analysts who need to work with very large datasets, or who want to leverage the power of distributed computing to speed up their data processing tasks.

python-koalas is a relatively new library, and is still under active development. However, it has already gained a significant following and is being used in a variety of applications.


# **Dataset**

The dataset we are using is the rate.csv file in the Health Insurance Marketplace Public Use Files from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace?select=Rate.csv.


&emsp;The rate.csv file is one of several CSV (comma-separated values) files that make up the Health Insurance Marketplace Public Use Files (PUF) dataset. The file contains information about the rates, or prices, of healthcare plans available on the individual market through the Health Insurance Marketplace also known as "Obamacare" marketplace. The dataset is collected by U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

&emsp;It provides detailed information about health plans, and pricing information available through the marketplace and its help researchers, consumer advocates, and policy makers to study and analyze trends in the individual health insurance market, understand the options, and costs associated with obtaining health coverage through the marketplace.

&emsp;It contains information about the different plans offered by insurance companies, including the type of coverage, deductibles, and out-of-pocket limits, and pricing information, such as monthly premiums, and financial assistance available to eligible individuals and families.

The rate.csv file contains the following columns:

  1. **BusinessYear**: The year of the plan
  2. **StateCode**: The code of the state where the plan is offered
  3. **IssuerId**: The unique identifier of the insurance company that offers the plan
  4. **SourceName**: The source of the rate information (e.g. the insurer, the state insurance department).
  5. **VersionNum**: A version number for the rate information.
  6. **ImportDate**: The date on which the rate information was imported into the Marketplace database.
  7. **PlanId**: Unique identifier of the plan
  8. **RatingAreaId**: The identifier of the geographic region where the rate applies
  9. **Tobacco**: Whether the rate applies to tobacco users or not
  10. **Age**: The age group for which the rate is specified
  11. **IndividualRate**: The monthly premium for an individual who selects the plan
  12. **IndividualTobaccoRate**: The monthly premium for an individual who selects the plan and uses tobacco
  13. **Couple**: The monthly premium for a couple who selects the plan
  14. **PrimarySubscriberAndOneDependent**: The monthly premium for a primary subscriber and one dependent who select the plan
  15. **PrimarySubscriberAndTwoDependents**: The monthly premium for a primary subscriber and two dependents who select the plan
  16. **PrimarySubscriberAndThreeOrMoreDependents**: The monthly premium for a primary subscriber and three or more dependents who select the plan
  17. **CoupleAndOneDependent**: The monthly premium for a couple and one dependent who select the plan
  18. **CoupleAndTwoDependents**: The monthly premium for a couple and two dependents who select the plan
  19. **CoupleAndThreeOrMoreDependents**: The monthly premium for a couple and three or more dependents who select the plan

Overall, the rate.csv dataset is an important resource that provides valuable information about the health insurance marketplace, which can be used to improve access to affordable health coverage for individuals and families.
