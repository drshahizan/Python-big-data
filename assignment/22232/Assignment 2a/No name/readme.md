<h1>Data Table As An Alternative To Pandas</h1>

Python package datatable was inspired from its counterpart R package data.table. It was developped with the aim to analyse BigData efficiently. Following is about datatable package. <i>Taken from datatable Github page</i>

The set of features that we want to implement with datatable is at least the following:

- Column-oriented data storage.

- Native-C implementation for all datatypes, including strings. Packages such as pandas and numpy already do that for numeric columns, but not for strings.

- Support for date-time and categorical types. Object type is also supported, but promotion into object discouraged.

- All types should support null values, with as little overhead as possible.

- Data should be stored on disk in the same format as in memory. This will allow us to memory-map data on disk and work on out-of-memory datasets transparently.

- Work with memory-mapped datasets to avoid loading into memory more data than necessary for each particular operation.

- Fast data reading from CSV and other formats.

- Multi-threaded data processing: time-consuming operations should attempt to utilize all cores for maximum efficiency.

- Efficient algorithms for sorting/grouping/joining.

- Expressive query syntax (similar to data.table).

- LLVM-based lazy computation for complex queries (code generated, compiled and executed on-the-fly).
LLVM-based user-defined functions.

- Minimal amount of data copying, copy-on-write semantics for shared data.

- Use "rowindex" views in filtering/sorting/grouping/joining operators to avoid unnecessary data copying.

- Interoperability with pandas / numpy / pure python: the users should have the ability to convert to another data-processing framework with ease.

- Restrictions: Python 3.5+, 64-bit systems only.
