# Assignment 7: Comparison between libraries
The assignment entails a comprehensive comparison of libraries optimized for big data applications, focusing on the challenges encountered when handling massive datasets using Pandas. Acknowledging the inherent limitations of Pandas, the exploration of alternative libraries, including Dask, Modin, Polars, and Vaex, becomes imperative for more effective and scalable data processing solutions.
