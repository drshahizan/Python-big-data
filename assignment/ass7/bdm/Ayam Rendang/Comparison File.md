## Introduction

The ability to process and analyze large amounts of data accurately is crucial in the quickly developing field of facts science. Part of this assignment compares and contrasts three Python libraries which are Pandas, Vaex, and Modin. The libraries are known for their unique abilities in information manipulation and analysis.

 ## Comparative Analysis
   | No. | Usual Pandas Method | Modin Method | Vaex Method |
   | --- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
   | 1.  | Visualisation : 774ms | Visualisation : 2.17s | Visualisation : 4.02s |
   | 2.  | df.info() : 33.2ms | df.info() : 21.6s | df.info() : 1.64 ms  |

## Conclusion 
Through the basic 2 comparisons, it is important to select the correct tool for tasks involving fact evaluation. The team decided to only compare with the  visualization execution time and df.info execution time for the comparison. These 2 basic comparisons, show all three tools have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of execution time. Overall Vaex method generates the data much faster compared to Pandas and Modin.
