## Introduction
In this assignment 7, it is a challenge for our group as we delve into working with datasets exceeding 1GB in size. Our primary objective revolves around conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and employing various data operations to extract insights from our selected dataset. To accomplish this, we'll be exploring 3 useful library tools that are functioned for handling large-scale datasets in python. This assignment involves investigating and assessing the efficiency of these tools in terms of their impact on data collection, manipulation, and the overall extraction of insights from these expansive datasets. By involving different libraries and studying the performance, we aim to uncover how each tool's functionalities and optimizations influence the efficiency of our data operations, providing valuable insights into their respective strengths and limitations in handling substantial volumes of data.


## Dataset Selection
The dataset our group had chosen is [Anime Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset?select=users-score-2023.csv) sourced from Kaggle. This dataset comprises data of 3 csv files, totalling over 70 million records and encompassing 44 columns, resulting in a data size exceeding 8.0GB. For this assignment the one file that we will be using is users-score-2023.csv

Columns and description from the User Score Dataset
| Column    | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| user_id   | Unique ID for each user.                          |
| Username  | The username of the user.                         |
| anime_id  | Unique ID for each anime.                         |
| Anime Title | The title of the anime.                         |
| rating    | The rating given by the user to the anime.        |

The User Score Dataset enables various analyses and insights into user interactions with anime. By examining user ratings for different anime titles, we can identify highly-rated and popular anime among users. Additionally, you can explore user preferences and watch patterns for specific anime titles. This dataset also forms the foundation for building recommendation systems based on user ratings, helping to suggest anime that align with individual tastes. Furthermore, you can perform collaborative filtering and similarity analysis to discover patterns of similar user interests. Overall, this dataset offers valuable information for understanding user engagement and preferences on the anime platform.
