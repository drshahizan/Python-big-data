# Assignment 7: Comparison between libraries
The assignment entails a comprehensive comparison of libraries optimized for big data applications, focusing on the challenges encountered when handling massive datasets using Pandas. Acknowledging the inherent limitations of Pandas, the exploration of alternative libraries, including Dask, Modin, Polars, and Vaex, becomes imperative for more effective and scalable data processing solutions.

## [Template: Project big data](./sample/compare_big_data.ipynb)

## üöÄ Instructions
1. **Dataset Selection (Minimum Size: 1 GB):** Choose a dataset larger than 1 GB from reputable sources such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/). Ensure that you provide a link enabling your dataset's utilization on Google Colab.

2. **Google Colab Compatibility:** Create the necessary operations and configurations that facilitate the seamless use of your chosen dataset on Google Colab. Include a link to your Google Colab notebook in your submission.

3. **Big Data Operations:** Implement operations specifically designed for big data within your chosen libraries (Pandas, Dask, Vaex, Modin) to maximize their capabilities in processing large datasets.

4. **Library Comparison:** Utilize at least three libraries related to big data processing (Pandas, Dask, Vaex, Modin) in your project. Systematically compare the processing results obtained from each library, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling significant volumes of data.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or Feature Engineering:** Apply the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or Feature Engineering to gain meaningful insights from your dataset. Use visualizations, statistical measures, and other relevant EDA techniques to enhance your understanding of the data.

6. Ensure that your submission is well-documented, providing a detailed explanation of the steps taken, insights gained, and a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of each library.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Markdown Document Creation:**
   - Generate a new Markdown document in Google Colab titled "*compare_bd.md*."

2. **Document Organization:**
   - Ensure that your Markdown document is meticulously organized, featuring clear explanations, appropriate headings, and well-structured bullet points for enhanced readability.

3. **Code Integration:**
   - Integrate Python code snippets seamlessly within the Markdown document to vividly illustrate the implementation of strategies. Clearly annotate each code section for easy understanding.

4. **Colab Notebook Attachment:**
   - Attach your comprehensive Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file) to the submission. The notebook should encompass all relevant code, annotations, and visualizations.

5. **Personal Information Inclusion:**
   - Include your name, student ID, and the date within the Markdown document to facilitate proper identification.

6. **Submission for Evaluation:**
   - Share both the Markdown document and the Colab notebook with your lecturer, following the specified instructions for submission and evaluation.
