## Introduction

In the dynamic realm of data science, the choice of tools and libraries significantly influences the efficiency and speed of data processing and analysis. As part of our collective endeavor to unravel the intricacies of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), our group has embarked on a comprehensive exploration of three powerful Python libraries: Pandas, Dask, and Modin. The primary objective of this project is to discern and compare the effectiveness of these libraries in handling diverse datasets and conducting EDA.

## Dataset Selection
The dataset encompasses property sales records starting from January 1995 up to the most recent monthly data available. It includes diverse transaction types, spanning from residential to commercial properties, offering a comprehensive perspective on the real estate market in England and Wales.

## 1. Exploring The Libraries 

### 1.1 Pandas

Pandas, short for "Panel Data," is a versatile Python library that revolutionizes data manipulation. At its core are two essential data structures ‚Äì Series and DataFrame. A Series is a labeled one-dimensional array, while a data frame is a powerful two-dimensional structure for tabular data.

* Library setup

```ruby
pip install pandas
```

```ruby
import pandas as np
```

### 1.2 Modin

Modin is a library in Python designed to accelerate data manipulation tasks, particularly those involving Pandas DataFrames. Modin stands for "Pandas on Ray" and aims to provide a fast and scalable alternative to Pandas by utilizing parallel and distributed computing.

* Library setup

```ruby
pip install modin
```

```ruby
import modin.pandas as pd
```

### 1.3 Dask

Dask is a parallel computing library in Python designed to enable efficient parallel computing for analytics, machine learning, and other computational tasks. It provides advanced parallelism for larger-than-memory computations using parallel processing and, in some cases, distributed computing. Dask is particularly useful when working with datasets that are too large to fit into memory.

* Library setup

```ruby
pip install dask
```
