## Introduction
In this project, we're exploring and analyzing the [Airline Delay Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherrytp/airline-delay-analysis?select=airline+delay+analysis) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains a lot of information about airline flights, including dates, airlines, delays at departure and arrival, reasons for delays, and other operational details. Our main goal in this project is to use the pandas library, a powerful tool in Python for working with data, to thoroughly investigate and understand this airline delay dataset. The project aims to uncover insights into various facets of airline operations, including on-time performance, operational metrics, and delay resolution.




## Dataset Selection
### **Airline Delay Analysis**

**Dataset used**: [Airline Delay Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherrytp/airline-delay-analysis)

- The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. I came across this useful data from DOT's database at working and figured this would be a really helpful dataset: Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flight.
- The datasets contain daily airline information covering from flight information, carrier company, to taxing-in, taxing-out time, and generalized delay reason of exactly 10 years, from 2009 to 2019. The DOT's database is renewed from 2018, so there might be a minor change in the column names. In this assignment, we use dataset of flight information in **2018** to do EDA and visualization.
-The flight delay and cancellation data were collected and managed by the DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, only included data related to time-analysis on each flight.

## Library Chosen
This document presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using three different libraries: Pandas, Dask, and Vaex. The goal is to compare the performance of these libraries in terms of time execution for typical EDA tasks.
### Pandas
- Description: Pandas is a popular data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames that are efficient for working with structured data.
- Website: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
### DASK
- Description: Dask is a parallel computing library that integrates with Pandas and extends its capabilities to handle larger-than-memory computations. It is particularly useful for working with big datasets.
- Website: [Dask](https://www.dask.org/)
### Vaex
- Description: Vaex is a high-performance Python library for lazy, out-of-core DataFrames. It is designed to work efficiently with larger-than-memory datasets and provides fast and memory-efficient operations.
- Website: [Vaex](https://vaex.io/)
