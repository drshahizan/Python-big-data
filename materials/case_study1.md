# Case Study 1: Airbnb
The case studies is about **Airbnb**, a global online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who offer accommodation and experiences. Airbnb has over 7 million listings in more than 220 countries and regions, and over 4 million hosts who have welcomed over 900 million guest arrivals¹.

Airbnb faces the challenge of analyzing and utilizing the massive amount of data generated by its platform, such as user profiles, reviews, ratings, bookings, searches, clicks, and more. This data is essential for Airbnb to understand its customers, optimize its products, and grow its business.

To address this challenge, Airbnb has built a data-driven culture and invested in various data science tools and techniques, such as:

- **Data infrastructure**: Airbnb uses a combination of cloud and on-premise solutions to store, process, and access its data. It uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its data lake, Apache Spark and Presto for its data processing, Apache Airflow for its data pipeline orchestration, and Druid for its data analytics²³.
- **Data visualization**: Airbnb uses various tools and frameworks to create and share interactive dashboards and charts that help its stakeholders gain insights from the data. It uses Superset, an open-source data exploration and visualization platform, as well as internally developed tools such as Dataportal and Airpal²⁴.
- **Data quality**: Airbnb ensures the quality and reliability of its data by implementing data quality checks, monitoring, and alerting systems. It uses Apache Amundsen, an open-source data discovery and metadata engine, to catalog and document its data assets. It also uses internally developed tools such as Databot and Minerva to automate data quality checks and flag issues²⁵.
- **Machine learning**: Airbnb uses machine learning to enhance its products and services, such as personalization, recommendation, pricing, search ranking, fraud detection, and more. It uses various frameworks and libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost, to build and deploy its machine learning models. It also uses internally developed tools such as Bighead and Zipline to streamline its machine learning workflow² .

These are some of the data science tools and techniques that Airbnb uses to deal with its large datasets.
