# The issues of using large datasets

Large datasets are becoming more common in many fields of research and applications, but they also pose some challenges and difficulties. Some of the issues are:

- **Sharing and accessing data**: The inaccessibility of data sets from external sources can cause substantial challenges. Sharing data can also cause challenges, such as ensuring data quality, compatibility, and security¹.
- **Privacy and security**: This issue includes sensitive, conceptual, technical, and legal aspects. Protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the data and the participants is crucial, especially when dealing with personal or sensitive data. This may require encryption, anonymization, or aggregation methods¹².
- **Analytical challenges**: These include challenges in data processing, data integration, data analysis, and data visualization. Handling large datasets requires appropriate tools, methods, and skills, such as parallel computing, cloud services, or specialized libraries. It also requires careful data cleaning, preprocessing, exploration, and visualization to identify patterns, outliers, and errors¹²³.
