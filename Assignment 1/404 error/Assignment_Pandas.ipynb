        "According to Wikipedia, EDA “is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods”. In my own words, it is about knowing your data, gaining a certain amount of familiarity with the data, before one starts to extract insights from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since EDA is such a crucial initial step for all data science projects, the lazy me decided to write a code template for performing EDA on structured datasets. The idea is to spend less time coding and focus more on the analysis of data itself. Scroll down to the bottom for the link to the code, but do read on to find out more about EDA and understand what the code does.
