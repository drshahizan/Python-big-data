# üìö Big data processing

**Big data processing** involves the systematic handling and analysis of vast and complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of traditional data processing methods. It encompasses the **storage, retrieval, and manipulation** of massive volumes of information to extract valuable insights. Key steps include **data ingestion**, where large datasets are collected from various sources, and **preprocessing**, involving cleaning and transformation to ensure data quality. Advanced **analytics**, **machine learning**, and **data mining** techniques are then applied to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. **Big data processing** is integral to informed decision-making, enabling organizations to derive meaningful conclusions from their data, optimize operations, and gain a competitive edge in today's **data-driven landscape**.

### [1. Big Data: Pandas](./materials/01big-pandas.md)
Big Data processing with **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, involves implementing strategies to handle large datasets efficiently. Scaling to sizable datasets requires adopting techniques such as processing data in smaller chunks using the '**chunksize**' parameter in Pandas **read_csv** function. This approach facilitates reading and processing large datasets in more manageable portions, preventing memory overload. To further optimize memory usage, it's essential to leverage Pandas' features like data types optimization, using more memory-efficient data types when possible. Additionally, utilizing advanced functionalities like the '**skiprows**' parameter and filtering columns during data import can significantly enhance performance. By mastering these strategies, one can effectively manage and analyze vast datasets in Python with **Pandas**, ensuring both computational efficiency and memory optimization in the face of **Big Data** challenges [**MORE** üí°](./materials/01big-pandas.md).

### [2. Big Data: Alternatives to Pandas for Processing Large Datasets](./materials/02alternatives.md)
This topic delves into the challenges encountered when using Pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis, in handling large datasets. Recognizing the limitations of Pandas, the article explores alternative solutions specifically designed for efficient processing of extensive data. It examines cutting-edge libraries such as Dask, Modin, Polars, Vaex, and others, showcasing their unique features and advantages. From parallel and distributed computing to out-of-core processing and GPU acceleration, the article provides insights into how these alternatives address the scalability and performance issues often faced when dealing with big datasets, offering readers a comprehensive guide to navigate the complexities of large-scale data processing beyond Pandas [**MORE** üí°](./materials/02alternatives.md).
