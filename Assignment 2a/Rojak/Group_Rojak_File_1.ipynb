        "For processing large datasets, Vaex Python's Out of Core Dataframe is a faster alternative to Pandas. It also has quick, user-friendly visualization tools. Pandas are typically used by Python developers when working with dataframes and processing. Its widespread acceptance can be attributed to its wide range of useful features and the simplicity of its application programming interface (API). However, pandas do not come without flaws, and Vaex can be used as an alternative. \n",

Histograms, density plots, and 3D volume rendering are used for visualization, making big data accessible for interactive exploration. Vaex achieves its high performance through the use of memory mapping, a zero memory copy policy, and lazy computations so that no memory is wasted."

Using the chunk size argument, you can specify the size of each chunk. Here, we use the %%time magic command to measure how long an operation takes to complete.

Vaex possesses a large number of additional capabilities and functions. Vaex is not only a viable alternative to Pandas, but it also provides features such as memory efficiency, easy parallelization, visualization tools, and a sophisticated query language. Memory mapping, a zero memory copy policy, and lazy computations are utilized by Vaex to achieve optimal performance."
